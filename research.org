At present, I'm carrying out my research activities as part of my post-doctorate
with the [[https://www.inria.fr/en/camus][Camus]]
([[https://www.inria.fr/en/][Inria]]) and
[[https://icps.icube.unistra.fr/][ICPS]]
([[https://icube.unistra.fr/en][ICube]]) teams, where I am working on the
automatic parallelization of C/C++ source code by task insertion (see
[[#research-post-doc][Automatic parallelization through task insertion]]).
However, to this day, most of my research activities have taken place as part of
my doctoral thesis at the University of Bordeaux within the
[[https://concace.gitlabpages.inria.fr/][Concace]] team. My thesis was focused
on the development of methods for solving large coupled FEM/BEM sparse/dense
linear systems arising from aeroacoustic problems (see
[[#research-thesis][Solvers for coupled FEM/BEM linear systems]]). That being
said, I took my first steps towards computer science research during my two
internships within the Camus and the ICPS teams, focusing on a new programming
structure, called XFOR, and the associated software tools (see
[[#research-xfor][XFOR programming structure]]).

* Automatic parallelization through task insertion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: research-post-doc
:END:

Today, multi-core processors can be found in most computers, from cell phones to
high-performance computing clusters. Nevertheless, designing and writing
parallel applications that make efficient use of these numerous computing
resources often remains the prerogative of experts with the technical knowledge
and time required to optimize their software. Numerous compilation studies have
addressed this issue and proposed different approaches to automatic
parallelization. These are traditionally oriented towards loop nest
parallelization, based on the polyhedral model. We are interested in task-based
parallel programming. In this model, the program is broken down into tasks
comprising one or more instructions. Tasks are associated with dependency
constraints to enable an execution engine to schedule and execute tasks in the
right order, i.e. respecting any dependencies between tasks accessing the same
data in memory. In this way, tasks that are independent of each other can be
executed in parallel. The challenge in optimizing this approach is to find an
efficient way of breaking down the initial program into tasks. In this context,
we are working on a tool for the automatic parallelization of C/C++ source code,
enabling us to analyze a sequential input program, find an efficient task-based
parallelism model and insert tasks at the right places in the input program.
Having implemented the preliminary analysis phases, notably the analysis of
dependencies between different instructions in the input program, we are now
exploring different strategies for automatically inserting tasks into the
program.

To implement our approach, we rely on the OptiTrust source-to-source code
transformation tool, to which we add the functionalities needed to analyze and
transform the original program. We work closely with the authors and
contributors of the [[https://github.com/charguer/optitrust][OptiTrust]]
project, in particular Arthur Chargéraud ([[https://www.inria.fr/en/][Inria]])
and Thomas Koehler ([[https://www.inria.fr/en/][Inria]]).

* Solvers for coupled FEM/BEM linear systems
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: research-thesis
:END:

In the aeronautical industry, aeroacoustics is used to model the propagation of
sound waves in the airflow enveloping an aircraft in flight. It is then possible
to simulate the noise produced by an aircraft at ground level during take-off
and landing, to ensure compliance with environmental standards and to enable the
design of future aircraft models. Unlike most other complex physics simulations,
the method consists in solving coupled linear sparse/dense systems. To produce a
realistic result, the number of unknowns in the system can be extremely large,
making its resolution a major challenge. My thesis [cite:@Thesis] focused on the
design and evaluation of algorithms for solving large linear systems of this
kind.

On the one hand, we proposed algorithms using the existing programming interface
(API) of fully-featured and well-optimized sparse and dense direct solvers such
as MUMPS [fn:mumps], HMAT [fn:hmat] and SPIDO [fn:spido]. Thanks to these
algorithms, we were able to bypass the major shortcomings of a basic usage of
these solvers and take full advantage of their advanced features such as
numerical compression, out-of-core computation and distributed memory
parallelism. In summary, compared with a state-of-the-art reference approach,
the proposed algorithms allow for processing up to 7× larger coupled FEM/BEM
systems on a single shared-memory multi-core machine, and more than 6.5× larger
coupled FEM/BEM systems in a distributed-memory environment.

In the research report [cite:@RR20], we began by formalizing and benchmarking
existing implementations at Airbus. Following the first new developments, I
presented a preliminary study of the proposed algorithms [cite:@Compas21] at
[[https://2021.compas-conference.fr/][ComPAS 2021]]. This national-level
peer-reviewed conference is ideally suited for PhD students seeking detailed
feedback on their preliminary work. The absence of conference proceedings is
voluntary and allows future submission of the work to an international journal
or conference, for example.

Indeed, we subsequently published our final study of all the proposed
shared-memory algorithms in [cite:@IPDPS22], which I presented at the
[[https://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2022/2022-.html][IPDPS 2022]] international
conference. This is one of the major events in the field, the reputation of
which is, and rightly so, well recognized by existing rankings, and in which it
is important to publish.

We also conducted a multi-metric study of the proposed algorithms, including
energy consumption, memory usage and number of floating-point operations
[cite:@SBACPAD22]. I presented this study at
[[https://project.inria.fr/sbac2022/][SBAC-PAD 2022]]. Firstly, the study
confirmed the interest in numerical compression and out-of-core computation.
Next, profiles of processor and memory power consumption, memory usage and the
number of floating-point operations gave us a better understanding of the
application's behavior. Finally, the study revealed a major bottleneck in our
implementation, as well as a potential load-balancing problem in the sparse
direct solver.

We then briefly presented our work in the short paper [cite:@Waves22] published
at the Waves 2022 conference [fn:waves].

Finally, the study of these algorithms carried out in a distributed memory
environment and presented in the thesis is currently the subject of an article
being prepared for publication.

The methods developed have been implemented and included in Airbus proprietary
software based on the MUMPS, SPIDO and HMAT solvers.

On the other hand, we evaluated an alternative solver API reyling on a coupling
of direct task-based solvers using the same runtime. A customized API allows us
to improve composability and to simplify data exchange between solvers for a
more efficient use of computational resources. While the introduction of such
substantial changes in fully-featured community-driven solvers can only be
considered in the long term due to the complexity of their source code (a few
hundred thousand lines of code), we were able to implement a proof of concept of
this approach in a reduced prototype. A preliminary comparative experimental
study validated our implementation, confirming that it can achieve the targeted
solution accuracy. In addition, we have illustrated the potential benefits of an
asynchronous task execution and shown that even a proof-of-concept of this
approach can compete with previously proposed methods as well as those in the
state of the art.

This work was the fruit of a collaboration with
[[https://www.irit.fr/~Alfredo.Buttari/][Alfredo Buttari]]
([[https://www.cnrs.fr/en][CNRS]], [[https://www.irit.fr/en/home/][IRIT]]). In
May 2022, I spent a week in Toulouse with the aim of working on the
incorporation of necessary changes in the sparse direct solver
[[https://qr\_mumps.gitlab.io/][qr_mumps]] we have used and which is developed
by Alfredo Buttari.

I had the opportunity to submit an abstract [cite:@Compas23] and present this
work at [[https://2023.compas-conference.fr/][ComPAS 2023]]. 

In addition to the main contribution, we devoted a significant effort to the
reproducibility of our work. To this end, we have explored the principles of
literate programming and associated software tools to ensure reproducibility of
experimental environments and the numerical experiments themselves running on
different machines and spanning over extended periods of time. The thesis itself
contains a chapter dedicated to this subject.

Moreover, the technical report [cite:@RT20] published as a companion to the
study [cite:@RR20] and describing its literate and reproducible environment
represents our first complete work implementing the reproducibility principles
studied. Subsequently, these community activity reports [cite:@Guix21;@Guix22]
document our ongoing efforts. In this context, I also contributed to the
GNU Guix package manager, helping to package new software and localize GNU Guix
and its documentation into Slovak.

* XFOR programming structure
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: research-xfor
:END:

The work I carried out within my Master's thesis was related to the field of
program optimization, and in particular for-loops, using the polyhedral model.
More specifically, I worked on the XFOR programming structure [cite:@XFOR]. Its
syntax is very similar to that of standard for-loops in the C language. However,
it allows several for-loops to be grouped together and managed at the same time.
Thanks to its two specific parameters, /grain/ and /offset/, the programmer can
change the way these loops are executed in a simpler, more intuitive way.

The goal is to adjust the order of execution of instructions within managed
loops, so as to highlight the possibilities offered by modern computer
architectures. The idea is to optimize the use of cache memory and to exploit
the parallelization capabilities of processors. A program rewritten using XFOR
can be up to 6× faster compared to its original version.

One of the main tools dedicated to this structure is the "Iterate, But Better!"
(IBB) compiler, which translates XFOR loops into equivalent for-loops. This way,
the translated program can be compiled by any C compiler. The need to compile an
XFOR program twice was one of the reasons for integrating the XFOR structure
into a production compiler such as Clang/LLVM. This would allow direct
compilation of XFOR programs and could help to promote the structure within the
programming community.

As part of my internship, I extended the lexical and syntax analyzers of the
Clang/LLVM compiler, so that it could recognize and correctly translate XFOR
loops. I also implemented the transformation of XFOR loops into the intermediate
representation used by the compiler (aka. LLVM IR) to produce executable files.
By the end of the internship, the extended Clang/LLVM
(\url{https://gitlab.inria.fr/xfor/xfor-clang}) was able to compile programs
with both simple and nested XFOR loops.

To make XFOR programs even more powerful, I then focused on strategies for
parallelizing XFOR loops using threads in order to allow for exploring of a more
coarse-grained parallelism. In particular, I studied the use of the OpenMP
parallelization library in XFOR programs.
