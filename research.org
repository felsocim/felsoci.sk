Currently I devote most of the time to the preparation of my Ph.D. thesis
focused on solving linear systems arising from aeroacoustic problem
modelizations. However, my previous research internships were related to the
domain of compilation and source code optimization. In my free time, I continue
to work on this subject.

* Solvers for coupled FEM/BEM linear systems
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: research-thesis

Numerical simulations are widely used in the aircraft industry. For example,
while testing and validating prototypes, various problems of electromagnetic and
aeroacoustic matter come into play. Within the industrial context of Airbus, we
are particularly interested in the modelization of aeroacoustic phenomena such
as the propagation of acoustic waves generated by an aircraft on landing and
taxying.

This kind of physical models are typically expressed using Partial Differential
Equations (PDE). The original models are likely to involve concepts that are not
modelizable on computers such as equations of integral functions. Therefore,
prior to computing the model numerically, an approximation of its original
physical expression must be made over a limited domain using an appropriate
discretization technique. For the problems my thesis is related to, a
combination of the Finite Elements Method (FEM) and Boundary Elements Method
(BEM) is applied.

Discretization allows to compute a system of linear equations approximating the
original continuous model. Higher the frequency is, e. g. more the approximation
is accurate, bigger the resulting linear system is. Such transformation
ultimately leads to coupled FEM/BEM systems with coefficient matrices having a
dense part corresponding to surface mesh discretization with BEM as well as
sparse parts corresponding to volume mesh discretization using FEM and the
interactions between the surface and the volume meshes.

To solve these linear systems, one must build on efficient solving methods and
software using algorithms and data structures optimized in such a way as to take
advantage of massively parallel hardware configurations and the characteristics
of the input linear system as much as possible. The goal of my thesis is thus to
develop and implement new algorithms for solving large FEM/BEM linear systems.

In order to ensure a better reproducibility of numerical experiments conducted
within my thesis, the latter relies on the principles of literate programming
[cite:@Knuth84] and uses GNU Guix [cite:@Guix] transactional package manager
allowing for self-contained, executable descriptions of experimental software
environments bit-for-bit reproducible across different computational platforms.

* XFOR programming structure
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: research-xfor
:END:

Thanks to my research internships during my university studies, I had the
occasion to discover and participate on the development of the XFOR programming
structure and related software tools designed within the
[[https://icps.icube.unistra.fr/][ICPS team]] at the
[[https://icube.unistra.fr/en/][ICube lab]] and I still continue working on it
in my spare time.

XFOR allows to handle multiple for-loops at the same time. Thanks to a couple of
parameters specific to the structure, the /grain/ and the /offset/, programmers
can act on the way the handled loops are executed. The goal is to adjust the
order of instructions within the loops in such a way as to improve the usage of
cache memory and take advantage of simultaneous instruction execution, namely
instruction vectorization capabilities of the target processing unit(s).

More information on the XFOR structure and its theoretical background can be
found in my [[https://felsoci.pages.unistra.fr/MastersThesis/][Master's
thesis]].
