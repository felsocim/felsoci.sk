:CUSTOM_ID: biography
:END:

Marek Felšöci was born in Košice, Slovakia in 1996. He received the B.S. degree
in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2017, the M.S.
degree in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2019.

From May 28 to August 24, 2018 as well as from January 21 to July 31, 2019 he
was a research intern at ICube Laboratory in Illkirch-Graffenstaden, Strasbourg
area, France where his work was concerned with compiler development and
polyhedral code optimization. From October 1, 2019 to January 31, 2023 he was
preparing a Ph.D. degree in computer science in the CONCACE (formerly HiePACS)
team at the French National Institute for Research in Computer science and
Automation (Inria) in Talence, France while being enrolled at the University of
Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. His thesis was focused on the design of fast solvers
for coupled sparse and dense linear systems arising from numerical modelizations
in high-frequency aeroacoustics. At the present, he works as post-doctoral
research fellow at the French National Institute for Research in Computer
science and Automation (Inria), in the CAMUS team hosted by the ICube Laboratory
in Illkirch-Graffenstaden, Strasbourg area, France. His current research
interest resides in automatic parallelization of C/C++ source code through task
insertion.

Marek Felšöci joined the [[https://afodib.labri.fr][Association de la formation
doctorale d'informatique de Bordeaux - AFoDIB]] (Ph.D. student society) in 2019
and held the position of secretary until 2022 since when he has been a regular
member of the society. During the academic years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, he was
elected Ph.D. student representative to the
[[https://ed-mi.u-bordeaux.fr/L-Ecole-doctorale/Conseil-de-l-Ecole-doctorale][Conseil
de l'École doctorale de mathématiques et d'informatique de l'Université de
Bordeaux]] (council of the doctoral school).

- *August 19, 2022*: Some time ago, I gave a talk and animated a 3-hour hands-on
  session on joint usage of Guix and Org mode for producing reproducible
  research studies.  If you want to discover these tools, feel free to try the
  hands-on session.  The
  [[https://tuto-techno-guix-hpc.gitlabpages.inria.fr/guidelines/][guidelines]]
  are self-sufficient. Do not hesitate to contact me, if you have any questions!
- *August 19, 2022*: The website had a major refresh (updated personal situation
  and blog posts, added a news feed, ...)
