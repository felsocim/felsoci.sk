:END:

Marek Felšöci was born in Košice, Slovakia in 1996. He received the B.S. degree
in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2017, the M.S.
degree in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2019.

From May 28 to August 24, 2018 as well as from January 21 to July 31, 2019 he
was a research intern at ICube Laboratory in Illkirch-Graffenstaden, Strasbourg
area, France where his work has been concerned with compiler development and
polyhedral code optimization. At the present, he is preparing a Ph.D. degree in
computer science at the French National Institute for Research in Computer
science and Automation (Inria) in Talence, France while being enrolled at the
University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. His current research interest is the
design of fast solvers for coupled sparse and dense linear systems arising from
numerical modelizations in high-frequency aeroacoustics.

Marek Felšöci joined the [[https://afodib.labri.fr][Association de la formation
doctorale d'informatique de Bordeaux - AFoDIB]] (Ph.D. student society) in 2019
and held the position of secretary until 2022 since when he has been a regular
member of the society. During the academic year 2021/2022, he was elected
Ph.D. student representative to the
[[https://ed-mi.u-bordeaux.fr/L-Ecole-doctorale/Conseil-de-l-Ecole-doctorale][Conseil
de l'École doctorale de mathématiques et d'informatique de l'Université de
Bordeaux]] (council of the doctoral school).

- *August 19, 2022*: Some time ago, I gave a talk and animated a 3-hour hands-on
  session on joint usage of Guix and Org mode for producing reproducible
  research studies.  If you want to discover these tools, feel free to try the
  hands-on session.  The
  [[https://tuto-techno-guix-hpc.gitlabpages.inria.fr/guidelines/][guidelines]]
  are self-sufficient. Do not hesitate to contact me, if you have any questions!
- *August 19, 2022*: The website had a major refresh (updated personal situation
  and blog posts, added a news feed, ...)
