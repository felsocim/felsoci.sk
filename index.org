:CUSTOM_ID: biography
:END:

Marek Felšöci was born in Košice, Slovakia in 1996. He received the B.S. degree
in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2017, the M.S.
degree in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2019.

From May 28 to August 24, 2018 as well as from January 21 to July 31, 2019 he
was a research intern in the [[https://icps.icube.unistra.fr/][ICPS team]] at
the ICube laboratory in Illkirch-Graffenstaden, Strasbourg area, France where
his work was concerned with compiler development and polyhedral code
optimization (see [[./research.org::#research-xfor][Research]]). From October 1,
2019 to January 31, 2023 he was preparing a Ph.D. thesis in computer science in
the [[https://www.inria.fr/en/concace][Concace team]] at the French National
Institute for Research in Computer science and Automation (Inria) in Talence,
France. His thesis was focused on the design of fast solvers for coupled sparse
and dense systems arising from numerical modelizations in high-frequency
aeroacoustics (see [[./research.org::#research-thesis][Research]]). He defended
his thesis [cite:@Thesis] on February 22, 2023 and was granted the Ph.D. degree
in computer science from the University of Bordeaux, France. At the present, he
works as post-doctoral research fellow at the French National Institute for
Research in Computer science and Automation (Inria), in
[[https://www.inria.fr/en/camus][Camus team]] detached at
[[https://icube.unistra.fr/en][ICube]] (within the
[[https://icps.icube.unistra.fr/][ICPS team]]) in Illkirch-Graffenstaden,
Strasbourg area, France. His current research interest resides in automatic
parallelization of C/C++ source code through task insertion (see
[[./research.org::#research-post-doc][Research]]).

Between 2019 and 2022, Marek Felšöci was a member of the
[[https://afodib.labri.fr][Association de la formation doctorale d'informatique
de Bordeaux - AFoDIB]] (Ph.D. student society). In 2019 and 2020, he held the
position of secretary. During the academic years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, he was
elected Ph.D. student representative to the
[[https://ed-mi.u-bordeaux.fr/L-Ecole-doctorale/Conseil-de-l-Ecole-doctorale][Conseil
de l'École doctorale de mathématiques et d'informatique de l'Université de
Bordeaux]] (council of the doctoral school).
