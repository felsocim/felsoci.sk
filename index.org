* Short biography
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: short-biography
:END:

Marek Felšöci was born in Košice, Slovakia in 1996. He received the B.S. degree
in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2017, the M.S.
degree in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2019.

From May 28 to August 24, 2018 as well as from January 21 to July 31, 2019 he
was a research intern in the [[https://icps.icube.unistra.fr/][ICPS team]] at
the ICube laboratory in Illkirch-Graffenstaden, Strasbourg area, France where
his work was concerned with compiler development and polyhedral code
optimization (see [[./research.org::#research-xfor][Research]]). From October 1,
2019 to January 31, 2023 he was preparing a Ph.D. thesis in computer science in
the [[https://www.inria.fr/en/concace][Concace team]] at the French National
Institute for Research in Computer science and Automation
([[https://www.inria.fr/en/][Inria]]) in Talence, France. His thesis was focused
on the design of fast solvers for coupled sparse and dense systems arising from
numerical modelizations in high-frequency aeroacoustics (see
[[./research.org::#research-thesis][Research]]). He defended his thesis
[cite:@Thesis] on February 22, 2023 and was granted the Ph.D. degree in computer
science from the University of Bordeaux, France. From April 1, 2023 to November
30, 2024 he was a post-doctoral research fellow working on automatic task-based
parallelization at the French National Institute for Research in Computer
science and Automation ([[https://www.inria.fr/en/][Inria]]), in
[[https://www.inria.fr/en/camus][Camus team]] detached at
[[https://icube.unistra.fr/en][ICube]] (within the
[[https://icps.icube.unistra.fr/][ICPS team]]) in Illkirch-Graffenstaden,
Strasbourg area, France. On December 1, 2024 he has joined the
[[https://www-pequan.lip6.fr/][PEQUAN]] team of
[[https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en][LiP6]] at
[[https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en][Sorbonne Université]] in Paris, France
for a second post-doctoral fellowship. His current research focuses on the
transition to mixed precision computation within a numerical processing block of
a distributed acousting sensing device (see
[[./research.org::#research-post-doc-1][Research]]).

Between 2019 and 2022, Marek Felšöci was a member of the
[[https://afodib.labri.fr][Association de la formation doctorale d'informatique
de Bordeaux - AFoDIB]] (Ph.D. student society). In 2019 and 2020, he held the
position of secretary. During the academic years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, he was
elected Ph.D. student representative to the
[[https://ed-mi.u-bordeaux.fr/L-Ecole-doctorale/Conseil-de-l-Ecole-doctorale][Conseil
de l'École doctorale de mathématiques et d'informatique de l'Université de
Bordeaux]] (council of the doctoral school).
