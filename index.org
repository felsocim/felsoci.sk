:END:

Marek Felšöci was born in Košice, Slovakia in 1996. He received the B.S. degree
in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2017, the M.S.
degree in computer science from the University of Strasbourg, France in 2019.

From May 28 to August 24, 2018 as well as from January 21 to July 31, 2019 he
was a research intern at ICube Laboratory in Illkirch-Graffenstaden, Strasbourg
area, France where his work has been concerned with compiler development and
polyhedral code optimization. At the present, he is preparing a Ph.D. degree in
computer science at the French National Institute for Research in Computer
science and Automation (Inria) in Talence, France while being enrolled at the
University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. His current research interest is the
design of fast solvers for coupled sparse and dense linear systems arising from
numerical modelizations in high-frequency aeroacoustics.

Marek Felšöci joined the
[[https://afodib.labri.fr][Association de la formation doctorale d'informatique de Bordeaux (AFoDIB)]]
in 2019 as secretary and has been elected a representative of the
[[https://ed-mi.u-bordeaux.fr/L-Ecole-doctorale/Conseil-de-l-Ecole-doctorale][Conseil de l'École doctorale de mathématiques et d'informatique de l'Université de Bordeaux]]
(Council of the Graduate research school) in 2021.
