#+TITLE: Teaching
#+AUTHOR: Marek Felšöci

After my first lecture in 2019, I came to enjoy teaching and I continue to give
lectures while working on my Ph.D. thesis. So far, I gave
call_compute-teaching-hours() hours of lectures.

** Compilation (48h)

For the last year of my Ph.D. I was really happy to be assigned with the
practical lectures in compilation. I was truly in my element!

** Digital skills and communication methods (13h)

I gave only several hours of practical lectures of beginner's digital skills to
the 1^{st} year Bachelor's degree students. The idea of the course is to prepare
the students to pass the national [[https://pix.fr/][PIX]] [[./images/fr.png]]
certification at the end of semester.

** Databases and web applications (32h)

In spring 2021, I was giving theoretical and practical lectures of relational
databases and web applications in the 1^{st} year of Bachelor's degree.

** Object oriented programming (32h)

In autumn 2020, I was giving practical lectures of object oriented programming
in Java in the 3^{rd} year of Bachelor's degree.

** Introduction to programming in C (64h)

:END:

During both the autumn and the spring semesters of 2019/2020, I was teaching
programming in C language to the students of /Brevet de technicien supérieur/
(BTS) - senior technologist's certificate in computer science.

Given that it was the first year of this curriculum in the institution, I was
also brought to propose an education plan, prepare the courses as well as
exercices and exams. The coronavirus crisis made my work even more difficult as
most of the lectures of the second semester had to be done remotely.
Nevertheless, it was a very valuable experience!

The teaching materials, exercices, exam and project assignments are
