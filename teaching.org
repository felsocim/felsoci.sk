After my first lecture in 2019, teaching has quickly bacome a passion for me and
I continue to give lectures whenever I can. So far, I gave
call_compute-teaching-hours() hours of lectures.

During the first semester of the 2023/2024 academic year, I was teaching in the
first year of a Master's degree in computer science.

** Compilation (72h)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: teaching-unistra-cc
:END:

This time, all my teaching was done in compilation. More precisely, I gave 48
hours of tutorials [fn:td] and 24 hours of labs [fn:tp]. As part of my
activities, I also took part in the preparation of the exam subjects and the
project.

[fn:td] referred to as /travaux dirigés/ in French
[fn:tp] referred to as /travaux pratiques/ in French

In 2020/2021 and 2021/2022, I was teaching various subjects in both the first
and the third year of Bachelor's degree.

** Object oriented programming (32h)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: teaching-ub-oop

In autumn 2020, I ensured 32 hours of labs [fn:tp] of object oriented
programming in Java in the third year of Bachelor's degree.

All the information about the course as well as the teaching materials are

** Databases and web applications (36h)

In spring 2021, I was assigned with 20 hours of integrated lectures [fn:il] and
16 hours of labs [fn:tp] of relational databases and web applications in the
first year of Bachelor's degree.

[fn:il] referred to as /cours intégrés/ in French; combine both lecture time and
exercices, unlike lectures in auditoriums called /cours magitraux/ in French


** Digital skills and communication methods (13.33h)

:END:

In the autumn semester of 2021/2022, I gave around 13 hours of labs [fn:tp] of
beginner's digital skills to the first year Bachelor's degree students. The
idea of the course is to prepare the students to pass the national
[[https://pix.fr/][PIX]] [[./images/fr.png]] certification at the end of
semester.

** Compilation (48h)

Then, in spring, I was really happy to be assigned with the tutorial
sessions [fn:td] and the labs [fn:tp] of compilation, 24 hours of each. I was
truly in my element!

In 2019/2020, I taught programming in C language to the students of senior
technologist's certificate in computer science [fn:bts]. The sessions combined
lectures with practice in the spirit of an integrated lecture [fn:il].

Given that it was the first year of this curriculum in the institution, I was
also brought to propose an education plan, prepare the courses as well as
exercices and exams. The coronavirus crisis made my work even more difficult as
most of the lectures of the second semester had to be done remotely.
Nevertheless, it was a very valuable experience!
